  abstract = {Fundamentals of Plasma Physics is a general introduction designed to present a comprehensive, logical and unified treatment of the fundamentals of plasma physics based on statistical kinetic theory, with applications to a variety of important plasma phenomena. Its clarity and completeness makes the text suitable for self-learning and for self-paced courses. Throughout the text the emphasis is on clarity, rather than formality, the various derivations are explained in detail and, wherever possible, the physical interpretations are emphasized. The mathematical treatment is set out in great detail, carrying out the steps which are usually left to the reader. The problems form an integral part of the text and most of them were designed in such a way as to provide a guideline, stating intermediate steps with answers. TOC:1. Introduction 2.

  abstract = {Scattering of electrons by a force center in a homogeneous electric field is considered. The oscillatory energy dependence of the cross section, due to interference effects accompanying scattering, is investigated. The feasibility of experimental observation of the effects is analyzed. A multichannel theory of electron scattering by atoms and a multichannel theory of photodetachment of negative ions in an electric field are developed. It is shown that the phase shifts of electron scattering by atoms can be determined with high resolution by measuring the cross sections for the photodetachment of the corresponding negative ions in an electric field.},

We demonstrate its potential by applying the method to the Kerr Hamiltonian. Fractional revivals sensitive to details in the quantum evolution are obtained semiclassically and provide decisive evidence for the validity of the approach far beyond the Ehrenfest time. There is no constraint on the initial state as is shown by reproducing fractional revivals not only for the usual coherent states but also for a shifted weakly excited Fock state.},

  abstract = {We develop a scattering theory to investigate the multiphoton transmission in a one-dimensional waveguide in the presence of quantum emitters. It is based on a path integral formalism, uses displacement transformations, and does not require the Markov approximation. We obtain the full time evolution of the global system, including the emitters and the photonic field. Our theory allows us to compute the transition amplitude between arbitrary initial and final states, as well as the S matrix of the asymptotic in and out states. For the case of few incident photons in the waveguide, we also rederive a generalized master equation in the Markov limit. We compare the predictions of the developed scattering theory and that with the Markov approximation. We illustrate our methods with five examples of few-photon scattering: (i) by a two-level emitter, (ii) in the Jaynes-Cummings model; (iii) by an array of two-level emitters; (iv) by a two-level emitter in the half-end waveguide; and (v) by an array of atoms coupled to Rydberg levels. In the first two, we show the application of the scattering theory in the photon scattering by a single emitter, and examine the correctness of our theory with the well-known results. In the third example, we analyze the condition of the Markov approximation for the photon scattering in the array of emitters. In the fourth one, we show how a quantum emitter can generate entanglement of outgoing photons. Finally, we highlight the interplay between the phenomenon of electromagnetic-induced transparency and the Rydberg interaction, and show how this results in a rich variety of possibilities in the quantum statistics of the scattering photons.},

Using a semiclassical approach, we calculate the electron flux on spherical detectors with various radii. The classically allowed angular range of the interference patterns on the spherical screen increases as the detached-electron energy is increased. In the classically allowed range, we find that there are always two trajectories going from the negative ion to the observation point on the screen, inducing quantum interference patterns. We have also extended the formulas into the tunneling region. The interference patterns also reflect the quantum angular distribution of electrons leaving the ion. A scaling property for the detached-electron flux is investigated. The accuracy of our semiclassical formulas is established by comparison with a quantum treatment using the exact Coulomb Green's function.},
